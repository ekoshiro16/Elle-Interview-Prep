// My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.
// I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

// Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

// To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

// The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
// The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
// Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
// Given all three arrays, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

// We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

// As an example,

//   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
//  Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
//   Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
// would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.

// But,

//   Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
//  Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
//   Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]
// would be first-come, first-served.

// Note: Order numbers are arbitrary. They do not have to be in increasing order.

// ************************************************************************************

// Hint guide:

// How can we re-phrase this problem in terms of smaller subproblems?

// Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems will clearly involve reducing the size of at least one of our lists of customer order numbers. So to start, let's try taking the first customer order out of servedOrders.

// What should be true of this customer order number if my service is first-come, first-served?

// If my cake cafe is first-come, first-served, then the first customer order finished (first item in servedOrders) has to either be the first take-out order entered into the system (takeOutOrders[0]) or the first dine-in order entered into the system (dineInOrders[0]).

// Once we can check the first customer order, how can we verify the remaining ones?

// Let's "throw out" the first customer order from servedOrders as well as the customer order it matched with from the beginning of takeOutOrders or dineInOrders. That customer order is now "accounted for."

// Now we're left with a smaller version of the original problem, which we can solve using the same approach! So we keep doing this over and over until we exhaust servedOrders. If we get to the end and every customer order "checks out," we return true.

// How do we implement this in code?

// Now that we have a problem that's the same as the original problem except smaller, our first thought might be to use recursion. All we need is a base case. What's our base case?

// RECURSIVE SOLUTION 
function isFirstComeFirstServed(takeOutOrders, dineInOrders, servedOrders) {

    // base case
    if (servedOrders.length === 0) {
        return true; 
    };

    // if the first order in servedOrders is the same as the first order in takeOutOrders, and also making sure first that we have an order in takeOutOrders
    if (takeOutOrders.length && takeOutOrders[0] === servedOrders[0]) {
        // take the first order off takeOutOrders and servedOrders and then recurse 
        return isFirstComeFirstServed(takeOutOrders.slice(1), dineInOrders, servedOrders.slice(1));
    
    // if the first order in servedOrders is the same as the first in dineInOrders
    } else if (dineInOrders.length && dineInOrders[0] === servedOrders[0]) {
        // take the first order off dineInOrders and servedOrders and recurse
        return isFirstComeFirstServed(takeOutOrders, dineInOrders.slice(1), servedOrders.slice(1));

    // first order in servedOrders doesn't match the first in takeOutOrders or dineInOrders, so we know it's not first-come, first-served
    } else {
        return false;
    };
};

// This solution will work, but we can do better.

// Before we talk about optimization, note that our inputs are probably pretty small. This function will hardly take any time or
// space, even if it could be more efficient. In industry, especially at small startups that want to move quickly, optimizing this
// might be considered a "premature optimization". Great engineers have both the skill to see how to optimize their code and the
// wisdom to know when those optimizations aren't worth it. At this point in the interview I recommend saying, "I think we can 
// optimize this a bit further, although given the nature of the input this probably won't be very resource-intensive anyway, should 
// we talk about optimizations?"

// Suppose we do want to optimize further. What are the time and space costs to beat? This function will take O(n^2) time and 
// O(n^2) space. 

// Whaaat? Yep, take a look at this code snippet: 
// return isFirstComeFirstServed(takeOutOrders.slice(1), dineInOrders, servedOrders.slice(1));

// and in particular, this expression:
// takeOutOrders.slice(1); 

// That's a slice, and it costs O(m) time and space, where m is the size of the RESULTING array. That is going to determine our
// overall time and space cost here - the rest of the work we're doing is constant space and time.

// In our recursing we'll build up n frames on the call stack. Each of those frames will hold a different slice of our original
// servedOrders (and takeOutOrders and dineInOrders, although we only slice one of them in each recursive call). 

// So what's the total time and space cost of all our slices? 

// If servedOrders has n items to start, taking our first slice takes n - 1 time and space (plus half that, since we're also slicing
// one of our halves - but that's just a constant multiplier so we can ignore it). In our second recursive call, slicing takes 
// n - 2 time and space, etc. 

// So our total time and space cost for slicing comes to: 

// (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1 

// This is a common series that turns out to be O(n^2). 

// But we can do better than this time and space cost. One way we could do that is to avoid slicing and instead keep track of indices
// in the array: 

function isFirstComeFirstServed2(takeOutOrders, dineInOrders, servedOrders, servedOrdersIndex, takeOutOrdersIndex, dineInOrdersIndex) {
    servedOrdersIndex = (typeof servedOrdersIndex !== 'undefined') ? servedOrdersIndex : 0; 
    takeOutOrders = (typeof takeOutOrdersIndex !== 'undefined') ? takeOutOrdersIndex : 0; 
    dineInOrdersIndex = (typeof dineInOrdersIndex !== 'undefined') ? dineInOrdersIndex : 0;

    // base case we've hit the end of servedOrders
    if (servedOrdersIndex === servedOrders.length) {
        return true; 
    };

    // if we still have orders in takeOutOrders and the currentOrder in takeOutOrders is the same as the current order in servedOrders
    if ((takeOutOrdersIndex < takeOutOrders.length) && (takeOutOrders[takeOutOrdersIndex] === servedOrders[servedOrdersIndex])) {
        takeOutOrdersIndex++; 

    // if we still have orders in dineInOrders and the current order in dineInOrders is the same as the current order in servedOrders:
    } else if ((dineInOrdersIndex < dineInOrders.length) && (dineInOrders[dineInOrdersIndex] === servedOrders[servedOrdersIndex])) {
        dineInOrdersIndex++; 

    // if the current order in servedOrders doesn't match the current order in takeOutOrders or dineInOrders, then we're not serving
    // in first-come, first-served order 
    } else {
        return false; 
    };

    // the current order in servedOrders has now been "accounted for" so move on to the next one
    servedOrdersIndex++; 

    return isFirstComeFirstServed2(takeOutOrders, dineInOrders, servedOrders, servedOrdersIndex, takeOutOrdersIndex, dineInOrdersIndex); 
};

// So now we're down to O(n) time, but we're still taking O(n) space in the call stack because of our recursion. We can rewrite 
// this as an interative function to get that memory cost down to O(1). 

// What's happening in each iteration of our recursive function? Sometimes we're taking a customer order out of takeOutOrders and 
// sometimes we're taking a customer order out of dineInOrders, but we're always taking a customer order out of servedOrders. 

// So what if instead of taking customer orders out of servedOrders 1-by-1, we iterated over them? 

// That should work, but are we missing any edge cases? 

// What if there are extra orders in takeOutOrders or dineInOrders that don't appear in servedOrders? Would our kitchen be first-come,
// first-served then? 

// Maybe. 

// It's possible that our data doesn't include everything from the afternoon service. Maybe we stopped recording data before every 
// order that went into the kitchen was served. It would be reasonable to say that our kitchen is still first-come, first-served, since
// we don't have any evidence otherwise. 

// On the other hand, if our input is supposed to cover the entire service, then any orders that went into the kitchen but weren't
// served should be investigated. We don't want to accept people's money but not serve them! 

// In interviews, when in doubt, ask! This is a fantastic question to talk through with your interviewer and shows that you're able 
// to think through edge cases. 

// Both options are reasonable. In this writeup, we'll enforce that every order that goes into the kitchen (appearing in takeOutOrders
// or dineInOrders) should come out of the kitchen (appearing in servedOrders). How can we check that? 

// To check that we've served every order that was placed, we'll validate that when we finish iterating through servedOrders, we've
// exhausted takeOutOrders and dineInOrders. 

// OPTIMIZED SOLUTION 
// We walk through servedOrders, seeing if each customer order so far matches a customer order from one of the two registers. To 
// check this, we:

    // 1) Keep pointers to the current index in takeOutOrders, dineInOrders, and servedOrders 
    // 2) Walk through servedOrders from beginning to end.
    // 3) If the current order in servedOrders is the same as the current customer order in takeOutOrders, increment takeOutOrdersIndex
    // and keep going. This can be thought of as "checking off" the current customer order in takeOutOrders and servedOrders, reducing
    // the problem to the remaining customer orders in the arrays.
    // 4) Same as above but with dineInOrders.
    // 5) If the current order isn't the same as the customer order at the front of takeOutOrders or dineInOrders, we know something's 
    // gone wrong and we're not serving food first-come, first-served. 
    // 6) If we make it all the way to the end of servedOrders, we'll check that we've reached the end of both takeOutOrders and 
    // dineInOrders. If every customer order checks out, that means we are in fact serving food first-come, first-served. 

function optimizedFirstComeFirstServed(takeOutOrders, dineInOrders, servedOrders) {
    let takeOutOrdersIndex = 0;
    let dineInOrdersIndex = 0;
    let takeOutOrdersMaxIndex = takeOutOrders.length - 1;
    let dineInOrdersMaxIndex = dineInOrders.length - 1; 

    for (let i = 0; i < servedOrders.length; i++) {
        let currentOrder = servedOrders[i]; 

        // if we still have orders in takeOutOrders and the current order in takeOutOrders is the same as the current order in servedOrders
        if ((takeOutOrdersIndex <= takeOutOrdersMaxIndex) && (currentOrder === takeOutOrders[takeOutOrdersIndex])) {
            takeOutOrdersIndex++;

        // if we still have orders in dineInOrders and the current order in dineInOrders is the same as the currentOrder in servedOrders
        } else if ((dineInOrdersIndex <= dineInOrdersMaxIndex) && (currentOrder === dineInOrders[dineInOrdersIndex])) {
            dineInOrdersIndex++; 

        // if the currentOrder in servedOrders doesn't match the current order in takeOutOrders or dineInOrders, then we're not serving
        // first-come, first-served
        } else {
            return false; 
        };
    };

    // check for any extra orders at the end of takeOutOrders or dineInOrders 
    if ((dineInOrdersIndex !== dineInOrders.length) || (takeOutOrdersIndex !== takeOutOrders.length)) {
        return false; 
    };

    // all orders in servedOrders have been "accounted for" so we're serving first-come, first-served 
    return true; 
};

// COMPLEXITY
// O(n) time and O(1) space 

// BONUS
    // 1) This assumes each customer order in servedOrders is unique. How can we adapt this to handle arrays of customer orders 
    // with potential repeats. 
    // 2) Our implementation returns true when all the items in dineInOrders and takeOutOrders are first-come, first-served in 
    // servedOrders and false otherwise. That said, it'd be reasonable to throw an exception if some orders that went into the kitchen
    // were never served, or orders were served but not paid for at either register. How could we check for those cases? 
    // 3) Our solution iterates through the customer orders from front to back. Would our algorithms work if we iterated from the 
    // back towards the front? Which approach would be cleaner? 

// KEY TAKEAWAYS
    // 1) Be careful of the hidden space costs from a recursive function's call stack! If you have a solution that is recursive, see
    // if you can save some space by using an iterative algorithm instead.
